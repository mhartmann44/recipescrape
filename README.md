recipescrape!
This is code to scrape from the BBC Food website and learn/create recipes using this information.
So far this project has functionality to:
-Read lists of ingredients from pages embedded in the main "Recipes for Four" page on BBC Food
-Using regex rules, cleans list to bare ingredients
-Learn which ingredients tend to go together based on these associations in the existing recipes
-Predict new combinations of these ingredients to create a new and nice flavor profile
